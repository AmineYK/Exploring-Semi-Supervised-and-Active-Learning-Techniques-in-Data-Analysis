# Exploring-Semi-Supervised-and-Active-Learning-Techniques-in-Data-Analysis

Semi-supervised learning and active learning approaches offer interesting avenues to explore when the data to which we have access are only partially labeled. These two types of strategies make it possible to take advantage of the information contained in unlabeled data in order to improve the performance of the final model. The first propose to incorporate this information within the training or the structure of the model, while continuing to exploit the labeled data as is the case in standard supervised learning. The second assumes that an oracle will be able to label a portion of the samples in a cyclical manner, and guides the selection of samples to be labeled, preferring those which will promote a significant improvement of the model.

The content of this work is primarily based on an article written by Ms. Mathilde Galinier on April 29, 2022, which can be found at the following link: https://www.aquiladata.fr/insights/semi-supervised-learning-active-learning-comment-tirer-profit-des-donnees-non-labellisees.

The sole purpose of the produced work is to present different techniques. It is by no means intended to achieve extraordinary performance improvements. In fact, even the case chosen is not particularly complex for applying these techniques with the goal of enhancing performance.
